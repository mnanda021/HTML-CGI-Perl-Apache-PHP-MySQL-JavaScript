            <figcaption>
              
              <p>Hello, Yes! we are Fashion-Club. We started our company in 2017 as a part our assignment. We believe that the only way to be truly successful in career is to build your dream around the life you want, not the other way around. This poses a bit of a problem in the fashion world. There are so many rules in fashion career; seasonal deadlines, the “right” press, minimal number of pieces per collection, celebrity endorsements… it’s exhausting. But it does not have to be.<br>
					* What is it that you want in your life? <br>
					*What is it that you want in your work? <br>
*How and where do these answers cross paths?<br>
We believe that is how you create a successful career. Right there, that sweet spot, that point at which you say, “Wouldn’t that be amazing?!” <br>Amazing is not illusive. Amazing is possible.we decided we wanted to help designers find their amazing.So we created <h2>Fashion Club</h2>, a place to learn, connect, share, and thrive. A place for independent designers (both newbies and seasoned) to build and grow their own AMAZING. </p>

          <figure><h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
            <figcaption>
              
              <p>People ask why we do monochromatic clothes; the reason is because we're thinking in proportion to the world. In this room, your head is going to look so much more interesting if it's on a monochromatic column. Whereas we think people think of outfits and gets a little too fussy, a little too detailed. we're always thinking of the line of a person standing with their head in a room and we always feel like a stalk, or a stem, or a pillar is nicer. we always think of everything architecturally.<br>"Where beauty is worshipped for beauty's sake as a goddess, independent of and superior to morality and philosophy, the most horrible putrefaction is apt to set in. The lives of the aesthetes are the far from edifying commentary on the religion of beauty."-<h2> Aldous Huxley</h2></p>

              <h2>What we do!</h2>
              <p>Fashion Club welcomes you with warm greetings. The purpose of this club is to help students pursue their fashion interests and bring fashion design to the P-CEP community.  The club is open to all students interested in fashion design or any aspect of the fashion industry.The club plans one major fashion show each year around the theme of Prom.  Other activities include guest speakers, a field trip to fashion shows and/or other fashion related events, homecoming golf cart, recycle fashion show and photo shoots.<br>The purpose of the Fashion Design Club is to act as a resource for anyone interested in fashion and/or fashion design on campus. The club’s goal is to educate members and share ideas in fashion design, pattern-making, garment construction and show production. Although fashion design encompasses a large variety of disciplines, the club will not participate in activities related to knitting. We will also not construct any garments for individuals on or off campus. By discussing designs and demonstrating methods of putting a complete garment together, the club will help students who plan to pursue a career in the fashion industry as well as those who design clothing as a hobby</p>
